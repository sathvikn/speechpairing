I was the chair of extemporaneous speaking ("extemp") on my speech and debate team and had to organize effective practice 
sessions by ensuring students were partnering with people who knew about different topic areas (International/Foreign Extemp 
or IX/FX, and United States/National Extemp or USX/NX), and had different levels of experience (Novice and Varsity).

After arranging groups for hours, I decided to write code to perform this task. Extemppairings.py reads from a text file (the attendance
sheet), and based on what the user inputs, sorts the students by skill level (Novice_Varsity), or content knowledge (FX_NX).
It then outputs a randomized list of students in the two categories.

Rounds.py also randomizes students, but this was written to organize tournaments that involved students competing in different
categories. It reads from a text file that contains the students sorted by their category and prints out sections of six students.
